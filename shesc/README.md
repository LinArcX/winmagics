## Shesc
Mimic Ctrl+l, Ctrl+u (clear: current line + entire screen) with Shift+Escape on cmd.

### Build and run from source
You can build shesc with different build-systems(gnu-make or visual-studio 2005) with different configurations.(x86,64 | debug,release).
But before compiling you need some tools:

#### build dependencies
- git
- clang(or gcc)
- gnu-make(or visual-studio)

## How use it?
You should open `shesc.exe` and let run it in background. The simplest way is just running `RunAsStartup.cmd`.(It copies `shesc.exe` in startup folder.)
